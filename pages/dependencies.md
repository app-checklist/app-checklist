# Dependencies

It's important to keep your dependencies up to date. Current dependencies makes
it easier to do maintenance. There are a couple solutions which make it really
easy to keep them up to date. For example [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/)
or
[Renovate](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/renovate).

Another point to keep in mind, is that your app depends on a specific OS version.
You should keep an eye on this, too. Google even requires you to have a current
target OS version.

- [ ] Have processes in place to keep dependencies up to date.
- [ ] Have processes in place to verify you app against new OS updates.
- [ ] Have processes in place to target always the most recent OS version.
