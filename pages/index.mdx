# App Checklist ðŸ“± âœ…

Mobile application developer face various challenges while building 
mobile applications.

- Apps are installed on user devices. No Docker for us and instead we have test our app on a magnitude of devices.
- Apps are updated by the user. Continuous deployment ends at the store. The user doesn't necessarily receives the app update.
- Store review processes
- Mobile devices have limited resources. While this has significantly improved, it still holds true for most of of the world.
    This means we have to optimize our code and our assets.
- App Stores don't allow to roll back versions

That's just some of the challenges.
Further reading can be found [here](/further-reading).

In order to make my and your life easier I present you this page, which contains 
some handy checklists for apps.

This page is intended for curious product manager and developers. It is not that technical so most people should understand it.

This page helps you to understand the requirements and challenges of mobile applications.

## What is this not?

This is not a ressource to get help for programming.

import fs from 'fs'
import path from 'path'
import { useSSG } from 'nextra/ssg'

export const getStaticProps = ({ params }) => {
  const metaJsonPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'pages/meta.json');
  const metaJsonFile = fs.readFileSync(metaJsonPath);
  const metaJson = JSON.parse(metaJsonFile);
  
  return {
    props: {
      ssg: { 
        toc: metaJson 
      }
    }
  }
}

export const ContentRenderer = () => {
  // And later we can get it inside MDX.
  const { toc } = useSSG();
  return <div class="horizontal-align">
    <br/>
    <div class="grid-container">
      {Object.entries(toc).slice(1).slice(0, -1).map((entry) => (
        <a key={entry[0]} href={entry[0]}>
          <div class="grid-item rounded-lg">
            <strong>{entry[1]}</strong>
          </div>
        </a>
      ))}
    </div>
  </div>
}
