# 🚀 Release Process

- [ ] Use staged rollouts
- [ ] Use feature toggles
- [ ] Use test channels to beta test the app
- [ ] Have the ability to force user to update. This _must_ be added before the first app went live because you can't add this after your app went live.

  These are things you'll need to consider before going live with your app, because they're really hard to add later on.

<Demo>
  For some reason this components needs a child node.
  This is likely a bug here:
