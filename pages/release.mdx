# ðŸš€ Release Process

These are things you'll need to consider before going live with your app, because they're really hard to add later on.

<CheckList>
    <Checkbox title="Start deploying you app at least to a beta channel of the store when starting your development" cb_id="start_fast">
    - This ensures that there aren't any nasty surprises when you want to go live
    - Depending on what your app is supposed to do, the store reviews can be pretty rough. It's best to know this as soon as possible.
    - Third party packages can contain undisclosed unwanted permissions
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox title="Use staged rollouts" cb_id="staged_rollouts"/>
    <Checkbox title="Use feature toggles" cb_id="feature_toggles">

      For example [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/)
      
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox title="Use test channels to beta test the app" cb_id="beta_test"/>
    <Checkbox title="Have the ability to force user to update" cb_id="force_updates">
    You want this in case your app talks to a web server. It's a great help to speed up the deprecation of old API versions.
    </Checkbox>
