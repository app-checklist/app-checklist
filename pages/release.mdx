<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  These are things you'll need to consider before going live with your app, because they're really hard to add later on.
</Callout>

- [ ] Start deploying you app at least to a beta channel of the store when starting your development.
  - This ensures that there aren't any nasty surprises when you want to go live
  - Depending on what your app is supposed to do, the store reviews can be pretty rough. It's best to know this as soon as possible.
- [ ] Use staged rollouts
- [ ] Use feature toggles
- [ ] Use test channels to beta test the app
- [ ] Have the ability to force user to update.
- [ ] Have a way to force app upgrades.
  - You want this in case your app talks to a web server. It's a great help to speed up the deprecation of old API versions.
