# Giving and getting access to the stores

Giving other developers (or getting) access to App Store Connect or Google Play Developer Console 
is an important part of the app development lifecycle.
It should be done as soon as possible because of [the release process](/release).

Not having access to the target account makes the development more error prone and harder for all involved parties.
- bundle/app ids
- push notifications
- 3rd party SDKs which need signing certificates
- double configurations
- dev and prod environment diverge -> loss of quality
- bugs can't be reliably reproduced
- release process can't be tested, see [the release process](/release) on why that's bad.

### [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) & [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/)

These are the portals of Apple to release apps for iOS, iPadOS and macOS.

### [Google Play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish)

This is the place where apps Android need to be uploaded to, in order to release them.

## Giving access 

You are client and you're ordering an app from a contractor or an agency.
It means you need to give your contractor access to the developer portals.

## Getting access

You are a contractor or agency and you need to develop an app for a customer.
This means you need to request access to the developer portals.
