title: "Expected features"
---

There are a lot of things to consider while building an app.
Besides the main feature of your app,
you'll have to consider the following expected features:

- [ ] Ask user to leave a review in the app stores
    - [ ] Android: [Google Play In-App Review](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review)
    - [ ] iOS: [StoreReviewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/)
    - [ ] Provide an optional feedback channel to avoid bad reviews
    - [ ] Provide an official support website
- [ ] Use a crash monitoring system
    - [Sentry](https://sentry.io/signup/)
    - [Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics)
    - [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/)
- [ ] Add a license screen
    - A lot of licenses of third party code legally requires you to show the license or attribution to the end user.
- [ ] Add an imprint
- [ ] Add privacy policy
    - Even though not every app collects user data it's a good practice to include a privacy policy to state this.
    - Google Play and Apples App Store require you to have this.
- [ ] Show version number in "about app" screen
